- Gemstones: allow for rolling items with weighted mods. More stones = more mods on item, capped at 30 points?
- Remove miscreations
- Buff non-synergy rings/nerf synergies/add more synergies with non-synergies/remove non-synergy rings(?). Also, simplify to avoid player confusion/make it easier to keep track (This could happen naturally in a lower level campaign)?
- Remove stoneskin/memory/power(?) potions, add replacements. Reactive more likely to be used.
- Add crafting item for rerolling uniques? Allow purchasing of uniques that have already been found?
- Let loose on character enchants, make them rarer than relic mods/random mods/upgrades
- Amulets: put more weight on on higher CRs/increase CR cap depending on campaign level. Alternatively, rework to encourage more focus on the creature instead of simply being a temp HP button. Also, simplify to avoid player confusion?
- Offer players more information before choosing prayer path.
- Allow storing of prayer path skips? Could help with any higher level mods that don't fit the character + reduce FOMO
- See if players like riddles in feedback
- Lower/smoother relic leveling prices
- Make SPA GUI + DB backend? Overkill, but exposure to cljs + less state management logic in backend, and fixes issue of too many command indexes
- Riddles: keep but reduce frequency? Mixed feedback
- Allow consumables to be used for free on initiative?
