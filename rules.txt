Amulets:
    Amulets contain a random trait from a random monster from a given CR.
    As a free action at the start or end of a turn in combat, once per long rest, you can activate the trait contained by the amulet for a duration, granting you its effects.
    The duration of amulet effects is 2 rounds + 1 round for each amulet CR (not effect CR) above 1.
    When upgrading amulets, or rerolling with crafting items, you may choose to keep the existing effect instead of the new one.
    Upgrading: Feed an amulet other amulets totalling at least its current CR capacity to get +1 CR tier.

Prayer Stones:
    You can use any prayer stone to pray to any Deity, but when using the appropriate prayer stone, you get the option of skipping a step

Moving mods:
    Between any items so long as all mods are compatible with new item. Incompatible mods can be removed as part of the transfer.

Enchant rules:
    Double flat, dice additions, and die size enchants on single attackers (don't have extra attack, not dual wielding).
    Double flat, dice additions, and die size enchants for cantrips targeting a single creature, including AoE cantrips that happen to only hit one creature..
    Multiply flat, dice additions, and die size enchants by the spell slot level for spells targeting a single creature, including AoE spells that happen to only hit one creature..
    Die size increases increase the size of a single die (2d6 -> 1d6 + 1d8, 8d6 -> 5d6 + 1d8).

Rings:
    Max number of rings worn = prof bonus
    Max number of ring points used = char level + highest attribute modifier
    Sacrifice: Smash n rings together (n > 1) to get a choice of 1 from n unique new rings that can't be of the same type as any of the inputs.
    Synergy rings = rings whose name starts with "The" = rings whose purpose is to interact with other rings.

Uniques:
    Unique items are, lore-wise, failed attempts creating relics, or at replicating items from myths/folk stories

Vials:
    As a bonus action, can be drunk or thrown at willing target within 20 feet.

Relics:
    Relics related to a specific personality are unlocked at a certain quest state.
    Last relic level (10) is a choice of level (new random mod from list of mods available on artifact, upgrade existing mod of choice, new random mod)
    Characters have one armour relic slot, and one weapon relic slot. Any relic they put on will automatically get levelled to that level, but those levels are static once defined (can't de-attune and re-attune).
    Characters can level up their relic slots (separately) at the following costs:
        1:  0 (start),
        2:  200,
        3:  300,
        4:  400,
        5:  550,
        6:  700,
        7:  850,
        8:  1000,
        9:  1000,
        10: 1000

Helmets:
    Character enchants only, spawn with 20 points of mods
    Can be destroyed for 2 orbs of personality, regardless of mods
    Players can attempt to mend a fractured helmet:
        Each mod has 40% chance to stay the same, 30% to upgrade (or progress), 30% chance to remove the mod completely

Orb of personality:
    Applying orb of personality either adds a new character mod or upgrades existing mod (or progresses an upgrade)
    After applying upgrade, if mod upgrade is not in progress, has chance to fracture (make unmodifiable), chance equal to (1 - 10/{points total on helmet})
